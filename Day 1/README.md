# 🚀 Day 1 of the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google x Kaggle 
Excited to kick off this learning journey focused on building intelligent, autonomous systems using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) powered by Gemini models.

## What I Learned Today: - 

### 🤖 Introduction to Agents
 Explored the AI Agents Whitepaper, which defines agent capabilities, reliability principles (Agent Ops), and secure interoperability using identity and constrained policies.

### 🤖 Hands-on Codelabs
💻 Day 1a – From Prompt to Action: Built my first AI agent that acts beyond static prompts using ADK + Gemini.

💻 Day 1b – Agent Architectures: Designed a multi-agent system with Sequential, Parallel, and Loop workflows — where specialized agents collaborate like a real team.

## Key Takeaways
✨ Understanding how to orchestrate multiple agents intelligently.
✨ Building systems that:
Think sequentially (assembly-line style)
Work in parallel (collaboration)
Improve iteratively (refinement loops)
